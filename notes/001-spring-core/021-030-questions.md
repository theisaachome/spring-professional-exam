### **What does the @Bean annotation do?**

- @Bean annotation is used in `@Configuration` class to inform Spring that instance of class returned by method annotated with @Bean will return bean that will be managed by Spring.

@Bean also allows you to:
  - Specify init method
    - will be called after instance is created and assembled
  - Specify destroy method
    - will be called when bean is discarded (usually when context is
getting closed)
  - Specify name for the bean
    - by default bean has name autogenerated based on method
name, however this can be overridden
  - Specify alias/aliases for the bean
  - Specify if Bean should be used as candidate for injection into other beans – default true
  - Configure Autowiring mode – by name or type (Deprecated since Spring 5.1)

### **Question 22**
### What is the default bean id if you only use @Bean? 
### How can you override this?

- When using @Bean without specifying name or alias, default bean id will be created based on name of the method which was annotated with @Bean annotation.
- You can override this behavior by specifying name or aliases for the bean.

```java
@Bean
public SpringBean1 springBean1() {
    return new SpringBean1();
}
```
```java @Bean(name = "2ndSpringBean")
public SpringBean2 springBean2() {
    return new SpringBean2();
}
```

```java 
@Bean(name = {"3rdSpringBean", "thirdSpringBean"}) public SpringBean3 springBean3() {
    return new SpringBean3();
}```
